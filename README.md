# Day-54---Higher-Lower-Urls
This project serves as a capstone for Day 54 of the '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.' It demonstrates my proficiency in leveraging the Flask framework and Python to create an interactive web-based game. Feel Free to go through the ReadME file to know how to utlize the code in the py file.

# 🎲 Higher or Lower Game 🎲

## 🎉 Oh Boy, Oh Boy, I've Done It! 🎉

I've just turned myself into the mastermind behind a web-based game of chance, all thanks to the magical spells of Flask and Python! 🐍✨

## 🚀 Features

### 🎯 The Stage is Set

Right when you land on my page, you're greeted with a tantalizing proposition: "Guess a number between 0 and 9." Think of it as a game show, and you're the star contestant!

### 🤣 A Picture is Worth a Thousand Laughs

And guess what? I didn't just stop at text; oh no, I spiced things up with a hilarious GIF! If the game doesn't get you, the GIF surely will!

### 🎲 Let the Games Begin

Behind the curtains, Python's random number generator conjures up a number, shrouded in mystery. The stage is set. The number is picked. Now, who dares to guess?

### 🤫 Pick a Number, Any Number!

You make your guess by tinkering with the URL. It's like whispering your secret guess into the game's ear.

### 🚦 Highs and Lows

Guess too high or too low, and my game lets you know—with style and flair! I even added a GIF for each outcome, serving the perfect visual seasoning to my textual dish.

### 🎉 Bingo!

Nail the number, and you're greeted with cheers, a virtual pat on the back in the form of another delightful GIF, and a triumphant message: you've found the number!

## 💻 Installation and Setup

### 🛠️ What You'll Need

1. **Python**: Make sure Python is installed. If not, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Flask**: Install Flask by running this command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

### 🎮 How to Run

1. **Download the Code**: Download this fantastic code from the GitHub repo. Unzip the folder and navigate to it in your terminal.

2. **Set the Flask App**: In the terminal, set the Flask app to `server.py`:
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=server.py
    ```
    > 📝 Note: If you're on Windows, use `set` instead of `export`.

3. **Run the App**: In the terminal, execute:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

4. **Open the Browser**: Open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🎊 Let's Play!

Make your guess by adding a number to the URL, like so: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/7`. Will you guess too high? Too low? Or hit the jackpot? Only one way to find out!

### 🌟 Pro Tips

- Stuck? Look for clues in the GIFs!
- Want to guess again? Just change the number in the URL!
